# 📊 State-wise Constituency Seats in India - Power BI Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a detailed visualization of the constituency seat distribution across Indian states and union territories (UTs). It includes insights on:

- Total seats by each State/UT
- Party-wise and coalition-wise seat breakdowns
- Interactive geographical mapping of constituencies across India

## 🧠 Purpose
This project was created to practice **data visualization**, **Power BI dashboard design**, and **political data analysis** using real-world inspired constituency datasets. It is ideal for data analysts, political researchers, and those interested in electoral analytics.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – Dashboard development and data visualization
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For creating calculated fields and custom logic
- **Data Modeling** – Relationship management between tables
- **Map Visuals** – To show geographical spread of constituencies
- **Bar Charts, Slicers, Filters** – For interactive analytics

## 📌 Key Features

- 📍 **State-wise Constituency Breakdown**: A bar chart showing total constituencies in each Indian state/UT (e.g., Uttar Pradesh - 403, Maharashtra - 294)
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Coalition Party Distribution**: Visuals showing total seats won by coalitions (e.g., NDA, INDIA, Others)
- 🧾 **Party-wise Constituency Analysis**: Interactive view of how many seats each political party holds across states
- 🗺️ **Map Visualization**: Pinpointed locations of state-wise constituencies on an India map
- 🔍 **Dynamic Filtering**: Use slicers to view data by state, party, or coalition

## 📁 Dataset (Simulated)
The data used is simulated to reflect real-world structures of:

- State names and constituency count
- Political parties and their respective seat counts
- Coalition categorization (e.g., NDA, INDIA, Others)

> **Note**: The dataset used is for demonstration purposes and may not represent current official election data.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.
2. Explore the visuals interactively using filters/slicers.
3. Customize visuals or update data sources as needed.

## 📚 Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with **Power BI dashboard design**
- Practiced **data cleaning**, **visual storytelling**, and **performance optimization**
- Improved skills in **DAX**, **geographical visualizations**, and **data-driven decision support**

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add time-series election data across years
- Integrate with live government API or real-time CSV updates
- Include voter demographics and turnout rates
